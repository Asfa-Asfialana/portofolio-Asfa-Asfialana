Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a beginner in coding. I'm a graduate majoring in precision plantation extension from the Medan Agricultural Development Polytechnic, and a lifelong learner who’s passionate about creating things that matter.
But I’m not just about code – I love telling stories, asking questions, and making ideas come to life. Whether it’s building a web app or hosting a podcast episode, I’m all in when it comes to crafting something meaningful.

## 💡 Why I Started Coding

My journey into coding didn’t start with a computer science degree. It started with curiosity and the desire to create a technology that could be beneficial for many people.
My job in 2024 will be as a digital village cadre for the smart village program, which leads to the awareness that knowing a lot about technology is very important. As a community empowerment worker, I fully understand that the community in the village does not use technology much to assist their daily activities, such as trading, farming, or even in governmental affairs. That is why I am very enthusiastic to learn about programming, coding, or even to create a project that can help every village community to develop and make their work easier.
One day, I wondered:  
> *“How does an app know what I click? What happens behind the scenes?”*  

That question led me down a rabbit hole. I discovered that coding isn’t just for tech geniuses — it’s a creative playground where logic and imagination collide.

I fell in love with the idea of:
- 🔧 Solving problems in creative ways  
- 🌱 Continuously learning and growing  
- 🌍 Building tools that can help people  

And since then, And since then I have been trying to learn everything about coding and meeting great people in the eco techno leader community who taught me about coding.

## 🎙 I Also Make Podcasts!

Outside of coding, I am writing a story on Wattpad and I host a podcast where I talk about love and life.
